You decide - a guide to make responsible fashion choices
2. **Project Description**
The app aims to empower users to make responsible fashion choices in alignment with Agenda 2030. It includes educational content, quizzes on sustainable fashion production, tips for responsible purchasing, and a directory of second-hand stores in Stockholm. The goal is to educate and inspire users to contribute to sustainable consumption patterns.

Some technologies used
- React Hooks (e.g., useEffect, useState, useCallback): You are using React Hooks for managing side effects, local component state, and optimizing performance.
- React Router: React Router (BrowserRouter, Route, Routes, Link) for handling navigation in the application. 

A list of your stretch goals and features I hope to implement
- Integrate Google maps API to have over map on the second hand stores in Stockholm.
- Ability for the user to add their own tips on the tips-page, as comments, this could also be an alternative to add on the second hand stores page.
